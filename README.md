# WebApp

This web application incorporates databases using sequelize.js and PostgreSQL for performing CRUD operations on data stored in PostgreSQL tables. 
Additionally, it utilizes a MongoDB database to manage user accounts. To access employee information, users are required to create an account and log in. 
Alternatively, predefined login credentials can be used to access the application and view its content.

My intention with uploading school assignments on GitHub is merely to build a portfolio of my work. Please do not Copy :).
